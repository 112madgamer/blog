# So I developed a blog

So I finally got around to start a blog. Not only did I start a blog, I also developed it from scratch. My general plans with this site is to publish articles about anything related to software. 

The first thing I did was to search the web for a nice open source blogging platform. After a bit of searching I figured it could be a fun task to write my own static site generator based on markdown, and so here we are.

## Why develop a blog from scratch?

I have found that there are quite a few benefits to this approach:

A **fine level of control** lets me choose if what I want to do with this site long-term. At some point I might want to extend this site so that it also serves as my “main” website where I now just have a collection of links.

**Extensible markdown integration** lets me write my articles in my favorite editor. It is rather easy to find a library to convert markdown to HTML. While I do not have fine grained control over the markdown language I chose to use, I still have good control over how it is post-processed. For instance, the byline at the top of this article is automatically generated by the static site generator I wrote. It gets the time and date from a hidden code block in this document that gets removed in post. Off the top of my head I can think of extensions like footnotes, iframes, and diagrams.

**Version control** gives me not just a history of the site itself, but also of the documents. Readers will be able to submit changes via pull requests or perhaps even new articles altogether. GitHub also serves as a convenient backup of my writings.

**No moving parts** like JavaScript or a backend makes this thing very cheap and easy to host and maintain. I can host this on Netlify‘s CDN for free and just have their build servers run my site generator.
